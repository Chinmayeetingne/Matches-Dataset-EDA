Exploratory Data Analysis on Matches Dataset
Overview
This project involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about cricket matches. The primary goals of the EDA are to understand the structure of the data, identify patterns and relationships, and extract useful insights. This README file provides an overview of the project structure, the steps taken during the analysis, and instructions for running the code.

Dataset
The dataset contains information about various cricket matches, including details such as the teams involved, the venue, the match outcome, and individual player performances. The dataset is assumed to be in CSV format and should be named matches.csv.
